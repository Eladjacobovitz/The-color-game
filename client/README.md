##Name of the app: The RGB color game


##Overview:
The RGB Color Game is a simple project developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project is an interesting color guessing game. The user/player has to guess the result of the given RGB color combination and find the correct output of the color mixture. The user can guess the color until the option finishes.

##So how can you play?
First, go to this link:  https://the-color-game-nu.vercel.app
than go to the server directory and open the terminal and run “node ./index.js”.

After you finish to upload the sever you can start.

Go to the game menu and press lets play. then youll see 3 different levels on the mid bar (easy, hard and very hard).
Pick your level and guess which number is represented by the RGB number on the top.
If you know what color it is. Simply press on the square. Dont worry if you don't succeed in guessing, you will have as many chances until the squares are over. 
Want to start over? just press on the button new color. 
Got it right the first time? Wanna try it again?  just press on the button new color or play again.
In what ways can you win? If you spend less time guessing and make fewer guesses, your score will be higher!
Are you curious about your ranking? Go to the home page (game menu -> exit) and then click on the records tab.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
